# Proper Backend Test Case

- Please implement the TODO's as you see fit
- We estimate that it should not take more than a few hours
- It is desired but not required to complete all the cases
- You are allowed to change anything in the project: structure, architecture, tech, etc
- Commit and keep the history as you would in any production project

Feel free to reach out if you have any questions.

## Purpose

After the test is delivered, we will analyse the code-base and call for an interview to talk about the result.

We believe that there is not right or wrong, unless you analyse the trade-offs.

We hope that the discussion will be a way for us understand the decisions you have made and how you approach problem solving, while allowing you to get a grasp of the way we work. 

## Patterns/practices we care about

- Domain Driven Design
- Event-Driven Architecture
- Command Query Responsibility Segregation
- Test Driven Development
